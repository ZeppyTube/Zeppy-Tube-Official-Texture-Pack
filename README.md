MODRINTH LINK, PLEASE DOWNLOAD FROM THERE: https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/zeppy-tubes-official-texture-pack

This pack was created by me, Zeppy Tube, because I wanted to change some little stuff in the game (changes shown below), because I didn't want multiple texture packs to do little stuff, so I just made my own to change it all
I never planned on releasing this, however after getting a few request for a release, I'm finally officially releasing this along with all the versions (Because I couldn't get multi support to work lol)

Changes to the game:
- -Replaced "Honey comb" name with "Wax".
- -Replaced "You died" text screen to "GAME OVER" in blue text.
- -Replaced any "{player} fell off of a/some {climbable object}" chat death message with "{player} fell off of a/some {climbable object} (Are you dumb?)".
- -Replaced splash text "Made by Jeb!" with "Made by Jeb (And Hatsune Miku)!".
- -Added splash text "Love Live!" in pink text.
- -Added splash text "LIQUIIIDDDDDDDD!!".
- -Added splash text "Your next line is "Is that a JoJo reference?"".
- -Added splash text "Sub to Zeppy Tube!".
- -Added splash text "I can't believe you've done this!".
- -Added splash text "Best edition!" (Idk if this was added or already here I think I added it).
- -Changed Turtle texture to Carl bot from discord (Texture may be messed up).
- -Changed Diamond sword texture to Master sword from Legend of Zelda (Shadow is reversed).
- -Changed Redstone dust texture to have my PFP on it (Zeppy Tube pfp character).
- -Removed map in item frame texture from the map.
- -Changed chainmail armor with Rina Tennoji school uniform+Rina board.
- -Changed chainmail helment texture to Rina board.
